# Eleventy Starter Project

This is a site using some basic constructs of [Eleventy](https://11ty.dev), such as data and partials with the [Liquid](https://liquidjs.com) templating language.

To get started with this project, be sure to have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your machine. The in your command prompt (e.g. Terminal.app) go to the project directory and follow these steps:

1. In your command prompt run `npm install` to install all dependencies needed to run this project.
2. Then run `npm start` which will start up Eleventy and generate the pages in the projectâ€™s root directory.
3. When Eleventy is ready, the command prompt will say `Server at http://localhost:8080/`.
4. Open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser of choice to view the site generated by Eleventy.

**Note:** Eleventy has live reload enabled by default, so any changes made to in your code editor will update in the web browser.
